                <div><img title ="I MADE IT ! . A human being with hammer hard, symbolizes hard working, walking with confidence from work, holding a loaf of bread to put on the table for the family, overcame the barriers meant to block, self motivated for his victory “I made it!”."src = "port-8.jpg"></div>
                
                <div><img title="A GIVEN ONCE OPPORTUNITY . A gear for a change, moving 30° clock wise, to give each person an opportunity. Each plate on its position to receive. Those who go extra miles and get themselves to working zones are the ones that usually and commonly make a better future for themselves Your success can never be on your comfort zone, get there into a danger and discomfort zone and grab what is good and comes your way. We don’t actually recognize what opportunities can make us be what we want to be for instance it is common that every child is sent to school, that’s the first opportunity that is given and some are born to just use what they have and be successful, be consistent on your goal and look what you will harvest at the end, grab what comes your way, use your living time effectively, you not born to be poor go out there, rather look like a fool if it takes to, to spoon yourself.
                    "src = "port-9.jpg"></div>
                <div><img title="YOUR MIND,YOUR ENGINE . What you put in mind is the result of the person you are. Best motivation comes from you and the best motivator is you. The text written on the art work speaks of the brain like a soil to decide what you plant in. The choice is all yours. Remember a good germination of a plant need watering, sunlight and a fertile soil. Be advised to take good choices about your self. Be protective of what comes in of your mind, most people are spiritually dead because of the things they grabbed not realizing they are to kill their capability, their strength and power of the engine,  brain. As long as you live , start again.

The is a saying which says “waisted time, never returns” ,on that note, make it a point that the time you have you use it effectively and positively"src = "port-11.jpg"></div>
                <div><img title="KUKO KONKE ,THROUGH IT ALL .
                    Fighting arrows, time, holding up graduation hat, rondevels, a bunch of sticks, hand plastering background texture. Emphasis on thedark and light. I don’t want to dwell more for art speaks for itself, I also used symbols toelaborate more of what is inside. We all know the struggle of a black child to get educated though difficulties and life consequences it is celebrated that you overcame and you will overcome. Make it an oath that through it all I will be what I want to be. I will not dwell more for the art speaks of itself, take life serious before it takes you serious." src = "port-4.jpg"></div>
                    <img title="ITHEMBA LANGOMSO ,A HOPE FOR TOMORROW . 
                    The best driver for better future is hope. A hard working woman flooring with bright colours of cow dung, who never minds the cracks of the floor and it’s dryness, wearing green clothes like a mother who’s left alone with no helper, carried an unrecognized and unknown graduate, marks of thorns under her feet. A hard worker is a true representative of hope for life is unpredictable but they push with all their efforts to see and rip the fruits of their discomfort for comfort. Never lose hope no matter what comes your way, keep on working, increase those possibilities of making it. To those who managed to afford in life nothing hurts like looking to your mother, your father, your gold hammer suffering for you to be what you are today and nothing in return , let’s give back loads of love and caring to those people.
