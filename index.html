                            My inspiration for creating art comes from hardworking individuals. My
                            artworks are a reflection of the daily inspirations I experience,
                            particularly the drive to work hard to put food on the table despite a
                            difficult upbringing. My artwork is built on inspiring people and
                            providing them with a sense of hope that will keep them going and
                            keep them striving for more. My pieces of art entice the audience to do
                            more investigation and learn more because they raise questions and
                            contain symbolism.
                            My audience consists of both those who have overcome numerous
                            obstacles and have worked hard to get where they are and those who
                            are still in school as a means of surviving and succeeding. My artwork
                            expands more on my discoveries as an artist and proves that hard work
                            pays off. My artwork should, in my expectation and hope, inspire
                            amazement, joy, excitement, motivation, and cheerfulness.

                            better understand and apply some techniques.
                            on printmaking and painting there is variation of symbols. On
                            printmaking I used woodblocks and on painting, self stretched canvases
                            with rough and smooth primed texture to commemorate the viewer to
                            the walked journey up to this far. They create thinking and imagination
                            time. I am inspired by many artists, and I will mention few like Andrew
                            Ntshabele, Donald Kilpatrick and Solomon Omolayo Omogboye.</li>

We don’t actually recognize what opportunities can make us be what we want to be for instance it is common that every child is sent to school, that’s the first opportunity that is given and some are born to just use what they have and be successful, be consistent on your goal and look what you will harvest at the end, grab what comes your way, use your living time effectively, you not born to be poor go out there, rather look like a fool if it takes to, to spoon yourself.

Remember a good germination of a plant need watering, sunlight and a fertile soil. Be advised to take good choices about your self. Be protective of what comes in of your mind, most people are spiritually dead because of the things they grabbed not realizing they are to kill their capability, their strength and power of the engine,  brain. As long as you live , start again.
